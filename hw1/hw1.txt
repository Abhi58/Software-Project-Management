1) Benefits of using scrum:
     a) Better product quality : Cutomers and stakeholders can easily determine if the 
        software matches their requirements during sprint reviews, thus making product 
        quality better.
     b) Team satisfaction and Productivity : Scrum address and enhances productivity and 
        team satisfaction by focusing on the work that is more valuable and rewarding to 
        the team, thus eliminating unnecessary work.
     c) Decreased time to market : Scrum delivers the product much faster than other 
        traditional methods as the development and delivery happens incrementally, thus 
        we don't have to wait for the entire project to finish for release.
     d) Increased return on investment : Higher return on investment is mainly due to 
        decrease in market release time and also there are very few defects due to less 
        wasted work and speed deployments.
     e) Transparency : Efforts, results and all the steps are visible to the internal members
        of the team, scrum master and stakeholders ( as they need to know the status of the 
        progress ), thus creating transparency in the project development.
     

2) According to Cynefin framework,the five problem domains are :
   a) Simple 
   b) Complicated 
   c) Complex 
   d) Chaotic 
   e) Disorder 

   Scrum is well suited for complex domain in the Cynefin framework becuase according to 
   complex domain we must first test something, analyse the obtained results and make our 
   next move based on the outcomes and feedback which can be effectively done using scrum 
   by using sprints.
